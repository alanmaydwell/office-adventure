Following an enjoyable evening carousing in a local pub you
have returned to the office to retrieve you laptop which you
prudently left in your locker.

The building seems eerily unfamiliar at this hour but
surely this is a simple task even though you are somewhat
befuddled.

Goal: get your laptop and go home.

Type 'help' for some info.
